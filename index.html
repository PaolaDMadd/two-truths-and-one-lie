      <p>A little joking, a little vitalistic, the "differently young" Italian expression defines a person who has
        reached more or less the threshold of "advanced maturity", between fifty and sixty years. A person aware of
        having gained a lot in energy,
        spirit and life expectancy, compared to the counterparts even half a century ago.</br>
        A person that the job market bias would tend to "expel", in favour of a more flexible and malleable generation,
        because less expensive and more ready to master technologies such as the digital one.

      <p> When I decided to change career I received a lot of negatives comments that made me think I was too old for
        this change, and the 2015 movie The Intern came to my mind. There are a lot of conference and a huge effort to
        raise awareness in the tech industry and not only, where diversity in tech it's a common topic, but what is
        really diversity? Can it work in other industries too? I decided that I will start writing a blog about my
        journey, trying to give an answer to these questions.
        In the meantime you can enjoy the movie. </p>

        <!-- presentation -->
        <p>Sometimes people works for years before asking themselves if they are truly happy about their life and
          achievements.
          In the tourism industry, the high people turn-over and long working hours can lead to easily lose connection
          with ourselves, our real passions or our goals in life.</p>
        <p>After almost 20 years, working in tourism and student's program exchange, I was missing myself and my
          creativity. So when the opportunity of a career change arose in October 2018, I took it! </p>

        <p>I got my first job as a marketing assistant for an e-commerce. The first thing I had to learn was to set my
          thunderbird signature in HTML and CSS. This is also how my journey with coding started.</p>
        <p>I signed up for the first workshop in town and started self-teaching me. I enjoy the creativity and the
          constant use of your brain to find a solution or learning something new.</br>

          During my journey, I discovered opportunities for learning to code in a safer environment where
          underrepresented groups, career changer and less young people are considered a plus, and every one is aimed by
          sharing the knowledge.</p>
        <p>This made me confident, and because I am not afraid of changes or re-start my life in a new country; in June
          2019, I decided to take a break from work and I invested all my time, energies and savings to to pursue my
          Life Project, became a web developer. </br>
          In the last year I spent my days building projects, writing/reading about coding, following workshops, lessons
          and conferences.</p>

        <p>After being a student at codebar I joined this charity, first as an organizer and now as HTML, CSS coach. I
          love working with developers from industry and being involved in the community.</p>

        <p> Unfortunately when I was ready for my job-hunting Covid-19 happened. This impacted to everyone, but I think
          for a career changer over 40y.o. made it tougher! To make this change happen, I understood that I needed a
          lift
          up, so I decided to try a bootcamp to improve my coding skills and learn backend languages. Also because I met
          a lot of career changer who thanking to bootcamps were able to create that bridge who led them to a new career
          path.
