      <p>The "differently young" (diversamente giovane) Italian expression sarcastically defines a person who has
        reached more or less the threshold of "advanced maturity". We now live longer than we used to compared to a
        century ago and it’s important to stay mentally young.<br />
        There are mature people, that a biased job market tends to leave out, in favour of a more flexible and malleable
        generation, because they are theoretically less expensive and are more ready to master technologies such as the
        digital ones.</p>
      <p>When I decided to change career, I received a lot of negative comments and discouraging advice. They kept
        pointing out the fact that I was too old for this change. Likely I remembered the movie "The Intern" (2015), I
        found it inspiring. In tech, there is a huge effort to raise awareness about diversity. But what really counts
        as diversity? </p>
      <p>I decided to start writing a blog about my journey into tech. I want to share my experience and shed some light
        on diversity and take it beyond gender. In the meantime you can enjoy the movie.</p>

        <!-- presentation -->
        <p>Sometimes people work for years before asking themselves if they are truly happy about their life and
          achievements.
          In the tourism industry, the high people turn-over and long working hours can lead to easily lose connection
          with ourselves, our real passions or our goals in life.</p>
        <p>After almost 20 years, working in tourism and student's exchange programs, I felt lost and was missing being creative.
          So when the opportunity of a career change arose in October 2018, I took it! </p>

        <p>I got my first job as a marketing assistant for an e-commerce company. The first thing I had to learn was to set my
          thunderbird signature in HTML and CSS. This is where my journey with coding started.</p>
        <p>I signed up for the first workshop in town and started self-teaching myself. I enjoyed the creativity and the
          constant use of your mind to find a solution and enjoyed the never-ending learning process.</br>

          During my journey, I discovered opportunities for learning to code in a safer environment where
          underrepresented groups, career changer and mature folks are considered a plus, and every one is encouraged to
          share their knowledge.</p>
        <p>This made me confident, and because I am not afraid of changes or of restarting my life in a new country; in June
          2019, I decided to take a break from work and I invested all my time, energies and savings to pursue my
          life project. I became a web developer. </br>
          In the last year I spent my days building projects, writing/reading about coding, following workshops, lessons
          and conferences.</p>

        <p>After being a student at codebar I joined this charity, first as an organizer and now an HTML, CSS coach. I
          love working with developers from industry and being involved in the community.</p>

        <p> Unfortunately when I was ready for my job-hunting Covid-19 happened. This impacted everyone, but I think it is tougher
          for a career changer over 40! To make this change happen, I understood that I needed a
          lift
          up, so I decided to improve my coding skills and learn backend languages and work on real projects with the help of a bootcamp.
					I learned that other career changers in my network had bridged that gap to find their new role. I aim to continously improve!
